## **Adding a model**[**​**](http://localhost:3000/building-and-deploying/Agent%20Basics/models#adding-a-model)

2. Review the information
3. Select **Add to Project**
4. Select the project you wish to add the model to
5. Provide a friendly name to help you remember the model
6. Select if you'll use the Airia Universal Key or if you want to provide your own credentials for the model provider

## **Editing a model**[**​**](http://localhost:3000/building-and-deploying/Agent%20Basics/models#editing-a-model)

You can revisit a model configuration at any time to edit the model display name, credential, prices or system prompt.

To edit a model:

2. Select the model you would like to edit

## **Adding a custom model**[**​**](http://localhost:3000/building-and-deploying/Agent%20Basics/models#adding-a-custom-model)

You can add models that Airia has not published when you bring your own key. This allows you to leverage existing accounts with model providers for the endpoints supported by Airia.

1. Navigate to the **Models** Library.
2. From the footer message, select **Add a model**.
3. Provide a display name, and select the model provider.
4. Add the model endpoint, and provide a model name. Find supported provider endpoints below.
5. To get the most of Airia's consumption tracking, input the price charged by the provider for model usage.
6. Select the input type, and provide a system prompt [Note: a system prompt is not required]
