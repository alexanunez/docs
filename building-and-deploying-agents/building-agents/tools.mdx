title: "Tools"
description: "Models can be extended via Tools, which can be configured to run via an API. Use Tools to work with your data where it is hosted, including your Database servers, or Google and Office 365 Documents. Tools offer OAuth, Basic Auth, and other secure authentication methods right out of the box"

The following providers support Tool integrations:

OpenAI

Azure

Anthropic

AWS Bedrock

To help you understand how we can use tools effectively, we created a short tutorial to show you how they can be used.

## **Configuring a Tool**[**​**](http://localhost:3000/Integrations/Tools/#configuring-a-tool)

When configuring a tool, you need to provide:

1. **Tool Description or Purpose**
2. **Example Use Cases**
3. **API Call**
4. **Parameters for your API**

### **Example: Setting Up a Google Search Tool**[**​**](http://localhost:3000/Integrations/Tools/#example-setting-up-a-google-search-tool)

This example shows how to set up a tool to perform a Google Search via an [API](https://serper.dev/?ref=alphasec.io).

#### **Steps to Configure**[**​**](http://localhost:3000/Integrations/Tools/#steps-to-configure)

1. **Navigate to a Project**

   Select "Tools" on the upper navigation bar, which will allow you to view the tools that are already in your Project.
2. **Select New Tool**

   Select the option to create a New Tool:

   This will take you to the library of new tools that you can add, or for you to create a new one.
3. **Add a tool to the library**

   You can either add a tool that is already available to you to the library, or create a new one with a custom definition.
4. **Adding a custom tool**

   When adding a custom Tool, you will see a page that allows you to configure the tool manually.
5. **Adding an existing tool"**

   You can also add an existing tool from the library, which will present you with a
6. **Provide authentication**

   Each Tool has it's own authentication, as dictated by the API Provider. Add this to the Tool by selecting on the corresponding field, and configuring it with the credendial.

   As an example, for a tool that requires Bearer Authentication, you would select Bearer authentication, and add the corresponding credential to it. You can select from one of the existing values, or create a new one before adding it.
7. **Create an Agent**

Add one of the models that support tools to the Agent:

11. **Edit the Tool**

Click the Model block to open the sidebar, and add a tool from the list and save:

11. **Save the Agent**

The tool should appear as part of the model footer:

## **Testing the Tool**[**​**](http://localhost:3000/Integrations/Tools/#testing-the-tool)

After adding the tool to an Agent, it can be tested via the playground. Test the tool by sending a query that prompts the LLM to use the tool. Tools work with both Streaming and Non-streaming methods in the Playground.
