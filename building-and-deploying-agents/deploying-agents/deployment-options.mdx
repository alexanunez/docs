There are two ways you can deploy Agents through Airia:

1. **Airia Chat** - You can choose to use the native Chat and allow End Users to switch between deployed Agents to get the support they need.
2. **API** - You can deploy the Agent via your own systems and tools via API to position the Agent in the intended setting, ready to be called into action and provide the outputs in your chosen system.

<Note>
  Note: Agents should be built and tested before following these steps.
