Data sources in the Aria platform enable you to integrate data from various origins into your Agent. Once a data source is added, the data undergoes ingestion, encoding, and storage in vector databases, making it ready for subsequent ragging and tooling operations.

Data Source connectors can be used to ingest different files, and use them as your knowledge in an Agent.

Managing a Data Source
After a data source has been created, it can be easily managed from the list view. Selecting a data source will allow you to view and edit key details, review the data ingested from that source, and adjust the ingest setup as needed. For file-based data sources, you can also upload files directly to the platform in this section.
