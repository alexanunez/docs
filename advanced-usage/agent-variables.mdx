You can now use the following set of system variables across prompts, tool fields, Python code blocks, and the agent router step. These variables provide greater flexibility and enable more dynamic behavior throughout your agent workflows. You can now access the list of updated agent variables just by typing “/”:

- `user roles and groups`
- `user input`
- `execution id`
- `previous step result (string value of the previous step, regardless of whether the steps are connected by a line)`

Note: We store user details using the user ID passed to the agent execution to retrieve information from our database.
