## Agent Intelligence Framework

Our comprehensive Agent Intelligence Framework enhances how you build and deploy AI solutions with three powerful capabilities:

- Dynamic System Variables - Access contextual information like user roles, execution IDs, and previous step results throughout your agent workflows, creating more responsive and personalized experiences.
- Human-in-the-Loop Controls - Insert approval checkpoints at critical decision points, ensuring human oversight for high-stakes actions, ambiguous situations, or customer-facing communications.
- Intelligent Workflow Routing - Direct requests to the appropriate handlers using our LLM-powered routing system that can process sequential or parallel workflows based on user input and conversation context.
